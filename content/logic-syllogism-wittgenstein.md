title: Reflecting on the most famous formal logic syllogism from the Wittgenstein's stunning phrase.
---

***K. J. Kasahara***

One of the most renowned examples of a formal logical syllogism is attributed to Aristotle:

    All humans are mortal.

    Aristotle is a human.

    Aristotle is mortal.

Let us examine each line in detail:

- Major premise: All humans are mortal.

- Minor premise: Aristotle is a human.

- Conclusion: Aristotle is mortal.

An intriguing question arises when we consider the veracity of the major premise.

Why is the assertion that "All humans are mortal" accepted as true?

Does this statement derive its truth from an inductive argument, moving from the particular to the universal?

Ludwig Wittgenstein’s phrase at the conclusion of his book "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" offers an alternative perspective on this matter. Wittgenstein stated:

    "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."

Does this imply that the major premise is something about which we cannot speak?

To explore this, we must recognize that there are two existential states for human beings: the living and the dead.

It is a verifiable truth that dead men are dead; this is a tautology.

However, is it possible to assert with certainty that living men will either be dead or live forever?

The answer is elusive. We lack the capacity to predict the future with absolute certainty regarding the mortality of all living individuals.

Hence, we must remain silent about whether all living men will eventually die or live eternally.

This silence is mandated by Wittgenstein’s principle.

Consequently, the assertion that all humans are mortal cannot be disproven through counterexamples, as it falls into the realm of the unspeakable.

The only verifiable truth is the mortality of those who are already dead. Therefore, we accept the premise that all humans are mortal.
