title: Digital Philosophy
---

Defining a clear boundary for this beloved term would be quite cumbersome. Digital Philosophy, at its core, shouldn’t diverge much from our metaphysical approach to “the world.” The shift, or rather the juxtaposition of the digital, is happening mainly in response to the demands of historical advancement. Decades ago, the IETF laid out the specifications for Email, and now most significant communications are conducted via Email. The purpose of Digital Philosophy aligns similarly. As digital philosophers, we don’t necessarily believe that the digital world will ultimately prevail. Our very existence reflects the recent reevaluation of philosophical concepts, driven by historical progress.
