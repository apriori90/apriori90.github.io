***Metaphysics*, Book I-III**

Atom:
- practical knowledge is wanted out of university
- "the end of theoretical knowledge is truth, while the end of practical knowledge is action
rennaissance philosophers came from religious figures
- instead of studying the scripture, one studies the classics such as the Greeks
most people are not seeking the root cause, they will be content with making their own stop gaps in describing causes
- most people are seeking short term goals, and understanding the fundamental "whys" are not within those goals
Everyone has a philosophy
- the difference is if you are consciously going to think about it, or if you gain it subconsciously from your environment
- what changed from the past to the current time is how philosophy is framed and collected, stored
  - records and legacy allows humans to examine consequences and results over a period of time

Aman:
- dissociate reality from the abstract
- experience and knowledge

Annisa:
- the "wise man" should be the one allowed to teach, since he ponders why things are instead of how they are
  - should this pragmatism healthy in the modern day society, university, academia
  - universities no longer hire academics, but those who with credentials and the "how", not necessarily the "why"
- Aristotle was relatively rich and had leeway to be more pragmatic, to be a scholar and spend his time and energy on philosophy
  - contemporarily, we can think about these concepts in our luxury and privilege

Collodi:
- university started within a religion of understanding 
  - the human spirit is the "cogito" of "cogito ergo sum"
- the truth is the result of philosophy
