title: December 10, 2024 â€” First Official Meeting
---

We held our first meeting this evening to plan our reading and writing schedule for the winter. We'll begin with Aristotle's *Metaphysics*, aiming to read three chapters (books) per week. Once we've completed *Metaphysics*, we'll move on to Plato's *The Republic*.
