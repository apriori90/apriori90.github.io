title: December 10, 2024 â€” First Official Meeting
---

We held our first meeting this evening to plan our reading and writing schedule for the winter. We'll begin with Aristotle's *Metaphysics*, aiming to read three chapters (books) per week. Once we've completed *Metaphysics*, we'll move on to Plato's *The Republic*.

Following guidebook materials are suggested:

- SEP Metaphysics (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/)

- The Problems of Philosophy by Bertrand Russell (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827)

- W D Ross' commentary on Metaphysics (https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.190825/page/n9/mode/2up)
