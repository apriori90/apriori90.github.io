> An intense feeling of happiness runs through Marcel when he brings a spoonful of tea with a little soaked piece of madeleine to his lips:
>
> “An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory -- this new sensation having had the effect, which love has, of filling me with a precious essense; or rather this essense was not in me, it was me. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal.”

The world is fragmented and each fragment are under the absolute domination of transparency. This implies that the concept of evil, Big Brother will slowly fade away. The conventional model of the digital panopticon evolved itself to make a unification between its control tower and residential area.


# Disruption of Measure Space and Ritual

Nostalgia is fundamentally based on the deviation and relativity between large and small values of measure space we constructed in our mind. When we feel the relatively far distance in the physical space (when you're far away from your hometown), or in the time-space (when you remind of some distant memories). I said “relativity” because if it wasn't close to you in the first place, there is no point being nostalgic when you’re far away from it. Vice versa, the satisfaction of meeting someone is based on the fact that you were far away from that person for some time.

The space of internetworked space contains a risk of destroying our measure space when they are leveraged wrongly. There is no distance in Layer 7 of the Computer Network.

When I was a small child, I had several chances to talk to my father’s friends, and some of them were electrical engineers. I wanted to become an engineer back then, so I asked them from time to time about what they were doing, or what kind of software I should use to build a circuit board diagram. When I recall, they were very nice people. However, I often could see their confused face, trying to avoid the question. Eventually, I ended up getting information from the prefectural library, magazines, and the internet. Later I met some engineer friends and most of them had a similar experience in their childhood. This implies the death of the ritual of teaching and guidance. The ritual is dead, and now only the non-contextual Q&A overflows.

It is often said that this is because people don’t love their work anymore. That is rarely true. The reason lies in the loss of ritual, where learners hand over their learning to the next generation. People of this time have a huge amount of knowledge (probably a lot more than people in the past) about their work, but their database is not relational, or graph-structured. They are key-value structured. That’s why you often see blunt comments like “please be more specific about your question” on the online forum. They can’t provide you an answer if you don’t give them an exact key they already have.

Then why the graph structure with context is turning into the key-value structure without narrative? Why this massive migration of our mind database is happening?


# In Search of Lost Time

Some rational people are indeed aware of the disruption of measure space in our communication. There are several cultural approaches to take back the distance between people, in other words, a ‘fragment of time in the pure state’ (un peu de temps à l'état pur). For instance, the Japanese Music Group, Yorushika (ヨルシカ), recently released a digital album, and they didn't release it on the online streaming service. Neither there is a CD/DVD with mp3 files. To listen to their music, you need to open their web application with AR functionality and scan their artbook every time. One might say this is strange because the group initially started their work on YouTube, where everyone can freely watch a video. However, we can boldly presume here that their goal was to take back the scent of our physical/time distance from the first place. I get the intention that this entire process is an homage to the time of LP, and vinyl record players. Placing the LP record on the turntable, adjusting the head and playing it. This type of procedure used to be a pure ritual to our music listening.

This approach is one of the most beautiful answers to the era of streaming music, nonetheless, there are some limitations in this method. First, the access-restricted web player already contains the recurring structure of a music streaming service. This method is beautiful and unique nowadays, but when many other music groups and streaming services start naming this style and turn this into a commodity, the beauty will lose its fragrance. Nietzsche, in his greatest work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, claims:

> My brother, if you have a virtue and it is your own virtue, you have it in common with no one.
>
> To be sure, you want to call it by a name and caress it; you want to pull its ears and amuse yourself with it.
>
> And behold! Now you have its name in common with the people and have become of the people and the herd with your virtue!
>
> . . .
>
> Let your virtue be too exalted for the familiarity of names: and if you have to speak of it, do not be ashamed to stammer.
>
> Thus say and stammer: ‘This is my good, this I love, just thus do I like it, only thus do I wish the good.’

# Claude Shannon's Scalpel for the Narrative Lobotomy

Shannon’s Information Entropy is based on the simple statement: the less it happened in the past, the higher the value of the information. If you're living in London, the information “it is raining” does not have much value. However, if you’re living in the South Pole base, “it is raining” will contain an enormous value. Thus, the way we value the information is completely different from that of narrative (物語); the value of information is measured by the level of instant stimulation the receiver takes.

One of the famous biographies of Claude Shannon, ‘A Mind at Play’, in its introduction, states:

> Before Shannon, information was a telegram, a photograph, a paragraph, a song. After Shannon, information was entirely abstracted into bits. The sender no longer mattered, the intent no longer mattered, the medium no longer mattered, not even the meaning mattered (...)

As mentioned above, now the stimulation is only what matters. Although, since it is human nature to long for a meaning and narrative (even if it’s almost degenerating as of 2020's) just as much as stimulation, various methods were developed to reconstruct a narrative as an upper layer, the 8th layer of OSI hierarchy. One attempt is that of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web. We don't know if he encountered Michel Proust’s works, but his idea of creating a woven fabric of information with WWW -- using HTTP as its thread -- is surprisingly similar to Proust’s ‘narrative temporal technique’. The fact that his autobiography about the creation of the Web is titled “Weaving the Web”, supports this idea.

# Michel Proust's Neurogenesis, and the Open Letter of Tim Berners-Lee

> Proust’s narrative temporal technique opposes temporal dissociation by framing events, uniting them into a coherent whole, or structuring them into certain periods. They are reassociated. A net of relations between events lets life appear liberated from sheer contingency and bestows significance on it. Proust is apparently convinced that in its depth life represents a densely woven net of connected events (...) [The scent of time]

The World Wide Web project was initiated in 1990 and generated a huge whirlwind with the era of the dot-com bubble. Its legacy is still continuing in the form of prestigious social networks and streaming services, reaching its peak by being leveraged as learning data of LLM models.

However, it is clear that Tim Berners-Lee is not really pleased with the current status quo of endless ‘innovation’. In 2017, he published a short open letter, titled “Three challenges for the web, according to its inventor (https://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/ )”. He proposed 3 major problems of the current Web.

> 1. We’ve lost control of our personal data.
>
> 2. It’s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web.
>
> 3. Political advertising online needs transparency and understanding.

This implies that his initial purpose in inventing the Web was to create a large-scale woven net of information, to build a whole new narrative on the decentralized Internetwork of computers. However, this contains the exact same flaw as that of democracy. Just like working democracy presumes the existence of long, proper discourse and book reading, proper usage of the Internet requires us to create our own woven fabric of knowledge.

Nonetheless, there is one principle overlooked by the blueprint of the Web, which was unnecessary back in the 90’s; the capacity of human conception can't recognize and understand a network as huge as the current Web. In fact, this was not such a surprising realization back then, so people were eager to create their own network of knowledge and attach that to the Web, leveraging the power of internetwork. This movement looked promising until the concept of a capitalized sharing economy of computing resources walked in to finish off the culture of self-hosting.

Theoretically, there is nothing that stops you from constructing a homebrew computing server. Whatever your daily computing device is, it always transmits and receives information. The server-client schema is merely a formalization of its request and response. The modern-day computing devices built on the Eckert Architecture (also known as Von Neumann Architecture) make it possible to turn your device into a fully functioning web server anytime you want, as long as it can communicate with prestigious protocols, such as TCP/IP.

In the level of convenience, running one's device 24/7 in your home has been often considered as sheer inefficiency. People started to entrust their duty and right of server administration to private companies. Rigidly saying, that there is no necessity of storing one’s data and that of millions of unspecified majority of people in the same server rack. The 1-to-N model is the logic of popularity. Nonetheless, people preferred such a system to omit their server maintenance process.

# Ruthless single-point convergence

As a result, information for/of each netizen started to gather in a single point. When you’re ‘chatting’, or collaboratively building a document with your friends, we all choose the most popular collaboration tool, in the name of efficiency. Henceforth, we will all start to learn to use a single, same tool, and there will be no room for the unique functionality found by each individual. This is an absolute dominance of totalitarianism, and the most absurd part is when they start to claim that they’re providing the tool for the uniqueness of everyone.

We need a portrayed image of the Web created by our own mind, not by the scrolling curation algorithm of the shared economy. Identifying the entire web as our shared mind/image of the world is the logic of a bee hive society. There must be a clear distinction between the object and its portrayed image of understanding.

There is a huge difference between shared protocol and shared computing programs/resources. One is based on the social agreement for better communication, and it is fundamentally ‘hackable’. While the protocol specification is public, anyone can build software practicing such a protocol. However, a shared program provides exactly the same experience for every user. You have no right to add any functionality. Even if they allow you to add a ‘plug-in’, they can always take back such allowance.

Thus we can safely enunciate that a disruption of measure space between various small software is also a disruption of computing rituals, which threatens our independent Dasein in the world of infosphere.

# One evening in Provence

In the Preface to the Korean Edition of The scent of time, Han says:

> One cannot cure an illness by merely treating the symptoms. What is needed today is not the time of work, but a revolution in time that creates a new time—a time revolution that restores scent to time.

As software developers, our job would be to find the method to restore the scent of time in the world we built within the last half a century. It’s not too late for us, since our hacker ethics always has been resisting against the logic of sacred labour, with the aesthetics of enjoyable games. Represented by MIT CSAIL's history, hacker ethics has been protecting the software industry from becoming a handmaid of Letzter Mensch (the Last man, from Thus said Zarathustra). That sublime patience which reminds us the standing up “to all the winds that blow in from the sea” like Camus said, is still present with various names, such as Free Software Foundation, GPL, and so on.

Nonetheless, times change, and our virtue of better development also requires a higher level of hacking, which is an endeavour of creating our own Umwertung aller Werte (Transvaluation of all values, Nietzsche).

Then Albert Camus, will remind us in his essays (mainly Almond Trees, and Prometheus in the Underworld) that our work should not be like “the theatrical kind on political platforms, complete with frowns and threatening gestures”, but “the kind that through the virtue of its purity and its sap, stands up to all the winds that blow in from the sea.” One evening in a random cafe, you might sit down, open your laptop with a cup of coffee, access your homebrew server independent from the totalitarian cloud, and build your software to serve “the whole man”. That is the moment where “we need to invent fire once more, to settle down once again to the job of appeasing the body’s hunger.”

We should reconstruct the software industry’s capitalism which is hacked by pariah capitalism (Weber). Hence, these shall be our ethics; Developing with a long-term perspective. Enjoying the process. ‘Just for fun’ (Linus). ‘In praise of Idleness’ (Russell). And finally, the cold frugality of the wise (Camus).

> If we must resign ourselves to living without beauty, and the freedom that is a part of beauty, the myth of Prometheus is one of those that will remind us that any mutilation of man can only be temporary, and that one serves nothing in man if one does not serve the whole man. If he is hungry for bread and heather, and if it is true that bread is the more necessary, let us learn how to keep the memory of heather alive.
