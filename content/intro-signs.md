title: Introduction to Signs
---

There exists many units of language. Morphemes, graphemes, phonemes; the list can go on potentially forever, as their existence is entirely contingent on linguists and their continued efforts in attempting to qualify a thing at once so fundamental and essential to our everyday existence, but at the same time complex enough to elude any one individual from describing it in exhaustivity. Let us not talk about units though, as is traditional for most disciplines or otherwise curious endeavours of analysis, and instead discuss an amalgamation of units, a totality of underlying layers, the “sign”.

Signs, when spoken of through the lens of analysis, refers to a conceivable thing that contains form, dynamism, meaning, and purpose. The study of such things has been called “semiotics” by those involved for the past century, as this field of study has developed a rigorous academic character. One of the founders of this academic field, as well as one of the coiners of the word “semiotics” or “semiology” according to him, was Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure, a Swiss philologist and philosopher, was among the first in modernity to describe language as a formal network of meaning, a semantic system. He assigned these forms “signs”, and his approach in qualifying these signs has become foundational in modern analytic linguistics.

According to Saussure, a sign must contain two elements in order to be distinguishable as one; the signifié, and the signifiant. The signifié denotes a mental concept evoked by perceiving the signifiant, an action, image or any perceivable piece of information which contains and is intended to communicate said concept or meaning. Pay attention to the last sentence, and one can notice the circularity of these two elements. They inform each other, in a didactic cycle imbuing each other with meaning. It is these signs which make up language, and it is through these signs with which language functions. Take for example the written and spoken word “dog”. One is sure to conjure up an image of, or at least the nebulous silhouette of the experience of perceiving, a dog in the mind when one sees or hears this word, despite the form of this word, either four latin alphabet characters strung together or sound waves entering the ear resembling the /dɔɡ/ sound, neither directly represents the physical object and experience of the animal known as "dog", nor does it contain within its form any inherent meaning.

Saussure and his contemporaries and their successors, from this start point, have managed to carve out a formal system within the monolithic serendipity of human language; Order from chaos.
