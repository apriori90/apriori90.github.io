This Digital Garden is the curated knowledge hub of the group *A priori*, dedicated to metaphysical/digital philosophy and systematic inquiry. Serving as a living archive, this space reflects the group's focus on bridging classical texts like Aristotle's Metaphysics with contemporary challenges in philosophy, mathematics, and computer science. It explores themes such as the harmony of logicism and existentialism, the preservation of archival knowledge, and the interplay of technology and philosophy. Designed for thoughtful engagement, the Digital Garden is a growing repository of insights, fostering both collaborative discovery and individual reflection.
